0. Lockboxes
mandatory
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
boxes is a list of lists
A key with the same number as a box opens that box
You can assume all keys will be positive integers
There can be keys that do not have boxes
The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False


In Python, "lockboxes" is not a standard term or concept. It's possible that the term is used in a specific context or within a particular library or framework, but without further context, it's difficult to provide a precise explanation.

If you encountered the term "lockboxes" in a Python-related context, it may refer to a specific implementation or pattern used for managing access to shared resources in a concurrent or multi-threaded environment. In such scenarios, locks or mutexes are commonly used to synchronize access to critical sections of code to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.

If you can provide more context or details about where you encountered the term "lockboxes" in Python, I'd be happy to provide more information or assistance.
