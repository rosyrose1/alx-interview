Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to many mathematicians before him. It is constructed in the following way:

The first row contains only the number 1.
Each subsequent row is constructed by adding together the two numbers directly above it in the previous row, with additional 1s at the beginning and end of each row.
Here's an example of the first few rows of Pascal's triangle:

    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
Each number in the triangle represents the combination of the row number and the position within the row. For example, in the fifth row, the number 6 is the combination of choosing 2 items out of 4 (4 choose 2), which equals 6.

Pascal's triangle has numerous interesting properties and applications in mathematics, including:

Binomial coefficients: The numbers in Pascal's triangle represent binomial coefficients, which have many applications in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.
Fibonacci sequence: Pascal's triangle contains the Fibonacci sequence in the diagonals.
Probability: Pascal's triangle can be used to calculate probabilities in certain types of experiments and distributions.
Combinatorial identities: Pascal's triangle helps to illustrate and prove various combinatorial identities and properties.
Overall, Pascal's triangle is a fascinating mathematical object that has been studied and applied in various fields for centuries.
